# Accurate and efficient computations with Wronskian matrices of Bernstein and related bases 


In this repository, the bidiagonal decompositions (BDA) of the Wronskian  Bernstein and related bases are provided.

1. In [BD_Wronskian_Bernstein](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/GramBernstein_NA2022/tree/main/BD_Wronskian_Bernstein]) the bidiagonal decomposition of Wronskian matrix of Bernstein basis is provided (see formula (30) in [1]). Using this bidiagonal decomposition and the functions available in [2], we also provide methods for solving to high relative accuracy  different problems of Numerical Linear Algrebra with Wronskian matrices of Bernstein bases (see Corollary 2 and Section 5 of [1]).


2. In [BD_Wronskian_Bernstein_NegativeDegree](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/GramBernstein_NA2022/tree/main/BD_Wronskian_Bernstein_NegativeDegree) the bidiagonal decomposition of Wronskian matrix of Bernstein basis of negative degree is provided (see formula (39) in [1]). Using this bidiagonal decomposition and the functions available in [2], we also provide methods for solving to high relative accuracy  different problems of Numerical Linear Algrebra with Wronskian matrices of Bernstein bases of negative degree (see Corollary 3 and Section 5 of [1]). 

2. In [BD_Wronskian_Negative_Binomial](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/GramBernstein_NA2022/tree/main/BD_Wronskian_Negative_Binomial) the bidiagonal decomposition of Wronskian matrix of negative Binomial  basis is provided (see formula (45) in [1]). Using this bidiagonal decomposition and the functions available in [2], we also provide methods for solving to high relative accuracy  different problems of Numerical Linear Algrebra with Wronskian matrices of Negative Binomial bases (see Corollary 4 and Section 5 of [1]). 

The implementation uses Matlab 2022b.
