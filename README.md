In this repository, the bidiagonal decompositions (BDA) of the Wronskian matrices of Bernstein bases of polynomials and other related bases such as the Bernstein basis of negative degree or the negative binomial basis are provided.

1. In [Gram_Bernstein](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/GramBernstein_NA2022/tree/main/Gram_Bernstein) the bidiagonal decomposition of the Gram matrix of Benrnstein basis of positive degree is provided. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica. 
2. In [Gram_Bernstein_Negative_Degree](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/GramBernstein_Negative_Degree/tree/main/Gram_Bernstein_Negative_Degree) the bidiagonal decomposition of the Gram matrix of Benrnstein basis of negative degree is provided. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica.
